# The shell integration feature allows you to use television as a picker for
# your shell commands(<CTRL-T>) and history (<CTRL-R>)
# E.g. typing `git checkout <CTRL-T>` will open television with a list of
# branches to choose from.

[shell_integration.commands]
# Add your commands here. Each key is a command that will trigger tv with the
# corresponding channel as value.
# Example: say you want the following prompts to trigger the following channels
# when pressing <CTRL-T>:
#          `git checkout` should trigger the `git-branches` channel
#          `ls`           should trigger the `dirs` channel
#          `cat`          should trigger the `files` channel
